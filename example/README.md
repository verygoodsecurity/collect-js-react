This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is linked to the collect-js-react package in the parent directory for development purposes.

You can run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` to test the package.

NOTE: Before start, make sure that you have configured `.env` file

```
REACT_APP_VAULT_ID=<vault_id>
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=<env>
REACT_APP_COLLECT_VERSION=<collect_version>
```
